/**
 * Interface for a map that holds component references and passes them to components
 * to establish dependencies with each other.
 *
 * Together with [[IReferenceable]] and [[IUnreferenceable]] interfaces it implements
 * a Locator pattern that is used by PipServices toolkit for Inversion of Control
 * to assign external dependencies to components.
 *
 * The IReferences object is a simple map, where keys are locators
 * and values are component references. It allows to add, remove and find components
 * by their locators. Locators can be any values like integers, strings or component types.
 * But most often PipServices toolkit uses [[Descriptor]] as locators that match
 * by 5 fields: group, type, kind, name and version.
 *
 * @see [[Descriptor]]
 * @see [[References]]
 *
 * ### Example ###
 *
 *     export class MyController implements IReferenceable {
 *         public _persistence: IMyPersistence;
 *         ...
 *         public setReferences(references: IReferences): void {
 *             this._persistence = references.getOneRequired<IMyPersistence>(
 *                 new Descriptor("mygroup", "persistence", "*", "*", "1.0")
 *             );
 *         }
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 *     let persistence = new MyMongoDbPersistence();
 *
 *     let controller = new MyController();
 *
 *     let references = References.fromTuples(
 *         new Descriptor("mygroup", "persistence", "mongodb", "default", "1.0"), persistence,
 *         new Descriptor("mygroup", "controller", "default", "default", "1.0"), controller
 *     );
 *     controller.setReferences(references);
