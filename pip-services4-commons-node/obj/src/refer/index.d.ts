 * Inversion of control design pattern. There exist various implementations,
 * a popular one being "inversion of dependency". Requires introspection and
 * is implemented differently in different languages. In PipServices, the "location
 * design pattern‚Äù is used, which is much simpler than dependency injection and is
 * a simple implementation, that is portable between languages. Used for building
 * various containers, as well as testing objects.
