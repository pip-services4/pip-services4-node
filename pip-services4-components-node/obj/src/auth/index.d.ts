 * @preferred
 * Contains credentials implementation.
 *
 * Credentials â€“ passwords, logins, application keys, secrets. This information is usually linked
 * with connection parameters. Connection parameters separate from authentication, because auth.
 * is saved as a secret, and stored separately from configuration parameters (host name, ip
 * addresses). They need added security and protection, so they were separated.
 *
 * Credential parameters include various credentials.
 *
 * Interfaces and abstract classes for credential stores, which can save or retrieve various
 * credential parameters.
